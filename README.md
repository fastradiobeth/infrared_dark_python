# infrared_dark_python
basic python code and outputs for use with catalogues of Hi-GAL IRDC sources.

#####Known issues with IRDP

* FITS cutouts of images have not been uploaded due to directory restrictions on number of files per directory
* Original IRDC cloud FITS files are also not present due to size and number
* pdf versions of the sources found in the full galactic longitude run have not been uploaded due to the number (~4000)

*All of the above are available from scratch space if requested.*

* Some (~5) pdf image files may be misplaced or missing due to rearrangements between categories. All cutouts and pdf files will be recreated for subcategories, with numbering from 0 in each category
* A large number of files have been renamed and moved to and from scratch space and pulls may take longer than expected
* source_print.py fills up the matplotlib cache whilst running due to the use of TeX characters. This will likely cause disk quota problems on JBCA accounts (standard limit is 300MB) when used to produce large numbers of pdf files, even if the output is to scratch space or external storage
* source_print, cutsources and main are all currently set up for finding FITS files with non-exact coordinate matches in map names, due to clipping of decimal places in the Hyper single wavelength catalogues in use. This will introduce problems if multiple IRDC files are found with a catalogue map coordinate as a substring (e.g. a catalogue source listed as in map 350.898-0.9 will be matched to every IRDC FITS file with HGL350.898-0.9xx in the name). *this is currently unavoidable without failure on >50% of sources when cutting from files*


Beth's favourite source is found at **infrared_dark_python/print_format_250_350_18.0asec/HGL28.087+0.067_160_quiet_printing_360.pdf**

#### SOURCE IMAGES
-------------------------------------------------------
######Marker colours
* 70 microns - blue
* 160 microns - green
* 250 microns - red
* 350 microns - black

#####1. **160-quiet sources**
  - The print format pdf files of all sources in **python_src_assoc_250_350_18.0asec.dat** are stored here, in the same order of appearance as the catalogue. The source images can be found in categories in 160_quiet_categories.
  - Note: some sources do not fit within boundaries of assigned map and may not be visible. Source 663 is also missing due to an unresolved issue whilst formatting the FITS file.

#####3. **'misclassified' protostellar sources**
  - print format images of the 65 sources found protostellar by find_counterparts but appear in the starless Hyper catalogue are in **protostellar_comparison/misclassified_print** 

#####2. **interesting sources**
  - This is the folder of sources found that fit various different subcategories within produced catalogues and suitably highlight differences betweeen objects found by the same find_counterparts_alpha run.
  - Description of sources is contained within the subdirectory

####160-QUIET CATALOGUES
--------------------------------------------------------
infrared_dark_python/find_counterparts_alpha.py outputs of sources detected in at least [250, 350] microns with no presence in 160 microns.

1. **python_src_assoc_250_350_18.0asec.dat** and **python_src_assoc_250_350_18.0asec_full.dat**
  - uses minimum required wavelength beam (18.0", 250 microns), reference wavelength 250 microns, and does not check for 70 micron sources.
  - Contains 841 sources.
  - Sources in this catalogue are used when sorting 160-quiet sources into categories

2. **python_src_assoc_70_250_350_10.2asec.dat** and **python_src_assoc_70_250_350_10.2asec_full.dat**
  - uses minimum required wavelength beam (10.2", 70 microns), reference wavelength 250 microns.
  - Contains 30 sources.

####160-QUIET CATEGORIES
--------------------------------------------------------
The sources in **python_src_assoc_250_350_18.0asec.dat** have sorted into 4 broad categories and some subcategories from visual inspection. Note that this sorting should not be taken as entirely accurate and is sensitive to human judgement. The entire set of Galactic Longitude 15 < l < 55 has been sorted into the categories as shown in the diagram alongside the number of sources of each type. (If image does not display, the pdf and png versions are in this directory).

Various plots in **plots/** show the longitude distribution of the 15<l<55 160-quiet catalogue, as well as the distributions of the categories and subcategories with some comparison to the multiwavelength Hyper catalogues starting *IRDC_l015_l055**.

Catelogues are in the *160_quiet_categories/* directory, with subdirectories containing the pdf images created by **source_print.py** in each main category- see note at top, subcategory directories will be created and missing sources recovered.


####PROTOSTELLAR CATALOGUES
--------------------------------------------------------
all outputs related for this section are located in **infrared_dark_python/protostellar_comparison/**
infrared_dark_python/find_counterparts_alpha.py protostellar catalogue has been compared to the Hyper catalogues of protostellar (70-350 presence) and starless (160-350 presence) sources and the following catalogues produced:

1. **python_src_assoc_70_160_250_350_10.2asec.dat**
  - output from find_counterparts_alpha.py of all sources with counterparts found in all four wavelengths. glon and glat of each counterpart centroid are printed, with one row per source.
  - Contains 1200 sources.
      
2. **python_src_assoc_70_160_250_350_10.2asec_full.dat**
  - output from find_counterparts_alpha.py of all sources with counterparts found in all four wavelengths. One row is used per wavelength band per source. Contains glon, glat, ra, dec and distance of source from reference wavelength centroid.
  - Contains 1200 sources.
      
3. **protostellar_hyper_proto_not_found.dat**
  - catalogue of Hyper protostellar sources not recovered by find_counterparts_alpha.py, in format of original Hyper catalogue.
  - Comparison used 70micron coordinates.
  - Contains 49 sources.

4. **protostellar_agreed_sources.dat**
  - catalogue of find_counterparts_alpha.py protostellar sources also found in Hyper protostellar catalogue.
  - Comparison used 70micron coordinates.
  - Contains 993 sources. 

5. **protostellar_misclassified_sources.dat**
 - catalogue of find_counterparts_alpha.py protostellar objects not appearing in Hyper protostellar catalogue but found in Hyper starless catalogue.
 - Comparisons against Hyper protostellar and starless catalogues used 70micron and 160micron coordinates respectively.
 - Contains 65 sources. 

6. **protostellar_extra_sources.dat**
  - catalogue of extra protostellar sources found by find_counterparts_alpha.py, appearing in neither the starless or protostellar Hyper catalogues. 
  - Comparisons run against Hyper protostellar and starless used 70micron and 160micron coordinates respectively.
  - Contains 142 sources.
      

All comparisons run using catalogue_compare_alpha.py. Catalogues 4, 5, and 6 are printed in the format of Catalogue 1.
Protostellar source catalogue was created using Hi-GAL wavelengths [70, 160, 250, 350]microns, 160microns as the reference wavelength and a maximum separation to be considered the same object of 10.2" (70micron beam).
