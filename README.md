basic python code for use with catalogues of Hi-GAL IRDC sources

PROTOSTELLAR CATALOGUES
--------------------------------------------------------
infrared_dark_python/find_counterparts_alpha.py protostellar catalogue has been compared to the Hyper catalogues of protostellar (70-350 presence) and starless (160-350 presence) sources and the following catalogues produced:

1 - python_src_assoc_70_160_250_350.dat
      output from find_counterparts_alpha.py of all sources with counterparts found in all four wavelengths. glon and glat of each counterpart centroid are printed, with one row per source.
      Contains 1200 sources.
      
2 - python_src_assoc_70_160_250_350_full.dat
      output from find_counterparts_alpha.py of all sources with counterparts found in all four wavelengths. One row is used per wavelength band per source. Contains glon, glat, ra, dec and distance of source from reference wavelength centroid.
      Contains 1200 sources.
      
3 - protostellar_hyper_proto_not_found.dat
      catalogue of Hyper protostellar sources not recovered by find_counterparts_alpha.py, in format of original Hyper catalogue.
     Comparison used 70micron coordinates.
     Contains 49 sources.

4 - protostellar_agreed_sources.dat
      catalogue of find_counterparts_alpha.py protostellar sources also found in Hyper protostellar catalogue. 
      Comparison used 70micron coordinates.
      Contains 993 sources. 

5 - protostellar_misclassified_sources.dat
      catalogue of find_counterparts_alpha.py protostellar objects not appearing in Hyper protostellar catalogue but found in Hyper starless catalogue.
     Comparisons against Hyper protostellar and starless catalogues used 70micron and 160micron coordinates respectively.
      Contains 65 sources. 

6 - protostellar_extra_sources.dat
      catalogue of extra protostellar sources found by find_counterparts_alpha.py, appearing in neither the starless or protostellar Hyper catalogues. 
      Comparisons run against Hyper protostellar and starless used 70micron and 160micron coordinates respectively.
      Contains 142 sources.
      

All comparisons run using catalogue_compare_alpha.py. Catalogues 4, 5, and 6 are printed in the format of Catalogue 1.
Protostellar source catalogue was created using Hi-GAL wavelengths [70, 160, 250, 350]microns, 160microns as the reference wavelength and a maximum separation to be considered the same object of 10.2" (70micron beam).
